## Overview
This project uses Python libraries to preprocess data, explore relationships between variables, and train machine learning models to predict crop prices.

## Features
1. **Data Analysis**:
   - Summarize and visualize the dataset.
   - Explore correlations and relationships between variables.
2. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - Handle missing and infinite values.
   - Stratified sampling based on the target variable.
   - Feature scaling and transformation using pipelines.
3. **Model Training**:
   - Train various models such as Linear Regression, Decision Tree Regressor, and Random Forest Regressor.
4. **Model Evaluation**:
   - Evaluate model performance using RMSE and cross-validation.
5. **Model Deployment**:
   - Save and load trained models using `joblib`.
